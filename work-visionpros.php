          I was asked to redesign the website to simplify the online order
          placing, and optimize for SEO and page load time.
        </p>

        <p class="small">Approach</p>
        <p class="large">
          First of all, I redesign the website home page to focus 2 or 3 key
          messages to deliver to the target audiences. New research by Google
          has found that 53% of mobile website visitors will leave if a webpage
          doesn’t load within three seconds.   Secondly, I analyzed the website
          statics for the past 3 months and focus on streamlining the page or
          section has the highest user drop-off rate. I have cut down the
          checkout steps to half to reduce time and clicks, and compress the
          website images to speed up the loading time. Lastly, I have researched
          and implemented several of long-tail keywords to focus on as
          beginning. In the meantime, I have suggested their marketing and
          social media team implement these keywords on their social media post
          and other marketing campaigns to maximize the page raking for their
          SEO.
